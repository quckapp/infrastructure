# Common proxy_set_header directives used across all location blocks.
# Include in location blocks via: include /etc/nginx/conf.d/proxy-params.conf;
#
# NOTE: This file is NOT auto-included by the *.conf glob in nginx.conf.
#       It is included explicitly by individual location blocks that need it.
#       The file extension .conf is kept for consistency, but nginx.conf only
#       includes upstreams.conf and security.conf at the http level.
